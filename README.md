### Hi I'm Vedang ðŸ‘‹
I Love to Develop Effective Optimized Solutions realizing the Latent and Expressed Needs of Problem Domain.

I love to create unique Solutions, whether it is Creating a Goverment UID Validator App or building up a whole new Solution for Building up a new Portal Straightway using Firebase and Node.js and this is exactly what I've done at Twinline Business Solutions and We Work, where I've gained a whole new exposure for Agile Methodology Implication.

I am fueled by passion for understanding the nuances of Project Development and Quick Implementation, and therfore has largely helped me in Developing Syntax-Semantic Analyser (Text Editor), ML Integrated Gym Excercise Model and Effective Map Routing JAVA based Application using Google Maps API from scratch.
Deep Learning , Data Science and Machine Learning really exictes me, and may dominate my work domain for Years to Come.
